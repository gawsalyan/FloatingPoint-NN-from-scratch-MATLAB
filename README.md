# NN-from-scratch
This is a try towards developing a nueral network toolbox for machine learning in Matlab especially for the purpose of devloping multi input lstm Layers. Since the development is not completed please report any errors or misconcept. Kindly accept any inconvenience.

## Currently available layers
  1. Fully Connected Layers
  2. LSTM Layers
  
you can find the example of creating layers in the TestNet.m and TestMultiNet.m files.
